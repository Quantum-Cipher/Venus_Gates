# 🔐 Venus Gate: Ritualized Access Validator

The Venus Gate is a symbolic Bash script designed for Eternum's signal architecture. It acts as a gatekeeper ritual, blending cryptography, lunar alignment, and prime logic to control access and trigger swap intent.

## 🌀 Features

- Prime number challenges (next after 17)
- Fibonacci sequence embedding
- Moon phase verification (New Moon seal)
- Symbolic rerouting into Eternal Shell with entropy logging
- Configurable for Vault Ritual screens and Firebase signal storage

## 🌕 Ritual Overview

Passing the Venus Gate requires entering a valid prime or Fibonacci number **and** being aligned with the New Moon. Incorrect entries are logged into an Eternal Shell ledger, simulating signal failure.
